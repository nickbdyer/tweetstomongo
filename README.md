#MongoDB Tweet Utility Server

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nickbdyer/tweetstomongo/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nickbdyer/tweetstomongo)

This server was created in order to have a simple method of writing tweets from
a text file to a Mongo Database. In doing so we were able to benchmark the
reading process from Mongo compared to creating a readStream from a text file. 

By using a mongo query at the point of reading, we discovered that in producing
an array from a list of 23000+ tweets, the readStream took 1.25ms whereas mongoDB took
1.09ms. 

The lessons from this experiment have been fed into our final project, where
instead of writing incoming tweets to a text file, we will now write them
directly to MongoDB in a stripped down form. We have a good idea of what
information we need to take from each tweet, in order to keep the data reading
and plotting as efficient as possible.
